<h2>Our Curation</h2>
<div class="accordion" id="section1">How do you select products for the Pink Moon shop?<span></span></div>
  <div class="container-faq">
    <div class="contentspacing--3">
    <p>Pink Moon has an intensely rigorous and intentional approach when adding a brand to our boutique. Our team is dedicated to thoroughly investigating the ingredients, mission, and efficacy of every brand we carry to ensure that they align with our ethos and meet our quality standards. </p><br>
            Every brand is female-founded, formulated with wholesome ingredients, sustainable, cruelty-free, ethically minded, and has philanthropic initiatives. Many of the brands we have curated are ones we've personally been using for several years as well.

  </div>
</div>
<div class="accordion" id="section2">What is the “Pink Moon ethos” and how do brands align with it?<span></span></div>
<div class="container-faq">
<div class="content spacing--3">
<p>To put it simply, we believe in supporting women on their wellness journeys. Because of this, all of our brands are female-founded and dedicated to creating safe beauty, wellness, and lifestyle products. Since we believe wellness is holistic, we also strive to carry brands that have social and/or environmental initiatives.<br><br>
If you're a founder of a sustainable + ethical wellness, lifestyle, or beauty brand and would like Pink Moon to carry your line, please email us at info@pinkmoon.co with a line sheet and more information about your products. 
  </p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="accordion" id="section3">Why is there a narrow selection of products in each category? <span></span></div>
<div class="container-faq">
<div class="content">
<p>Our tight curation is by design. We believe that it's important to feel an aura of calm and peace when creating a self-care ritual. Our research shows that product overwhelm is a common problem that many women have when shopping and that this overwhelm often causes feelings of frustration and confusion. </p><br>
<p>To combat this, we have intentionally curated a small selection of effective products to create an easier, more pleasant (and fun!) shopping experience.  
  </p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="accordion" id="section4">Can I experience the Pink Moon curation in person?<span></span></div>
<div class="container-faq">
<div class="content">
<p>Not quite yet. We are aiming to open a Pink Moon retail + wellcare space in the Upper West Side of Manhattan, NYC in 2021. We also hope to expand both domestically and internationally.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Our Compassion Committment</h2>
<div class="accordion" id="section5">What is Givz?<span></span></div>
  <div class="container-faq">
    <div class="content">
    <p>Philanthropy is important to us, so we have partnered with Givz, a platform that facilitates donations with charitable organizations of our choosing. When you shop with us, you'll receive a portion of what you spend as "cash back", which will go to one of the charities we have partnered with through Givz. </p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="accordion" id="section6">Are any of the products sold at Pink Moon ever tested on animals?<span></span></div>
<div class="container-faq">
<div class="content">
<p>We are proud to say that every single product in our curation is cruelty free! However, we would like to clarify that even though none of the products we carry are tested on animals, not all of them are vegan. Our vegan products are all denoted as being such on their respective product pages.
  </p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="accordion" id="section7">Lhamour uses a few animal derived ingredients that I am unfamiliar with. <br>Can you share more about the ingredients and their sourcing? <span></span></div>
<div class="container-faq">
<div class="content">
<p>Lhamour strives to honor Mongolian nomadism and history while paying homage to the centuries old Mongolian approach of skin healing. This approach led to formulations based on deeply cultural medicinal practices. Ingredients, like grass-fed tallow, are harvested in ethical and sustainable ways that promote compassion for nomads, their animals, and the environment.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="accordion" id="section8">Are the products sold at Pink Moon sustainable?<span></span></div>
<div class="container-faq">
<div class="content">
<p>Yes! But in very different ways. We only work with brands that value sustainability, and for some brands that manifests in packaging (all of our brands are working towards eliminating plastic), ingredient sourcing, or their philanthropic work! Our products in low waste packaging are all denoted as being such on their respective product pages.<br><br>

  We also strive to be as sustainable as possible. We do not use packing peanuts when shipping as we opt to use recyclable kraft paper instead, we also reuse packing materials from our suppliers in order to extend the life of these existing materials. We are always striving to better our sustainability efforts and invite your feedback to help us improve!</p>
